# CFSStandGrowth4R

An R client for the CFSStandGrowth Web API.

## Introduction

The CFSStandGrowth4R package gives access to the CFSStandGrowth Web API, which
is a repository of meta-models. Meta-models are simpler models fitted on the
predictions of more complex tree- or stand-level models. Being fitted to inventory data,
these meta-models apply at the landscape level. The method for fitting these meta-models
is described in [Fortin et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2022-0002).

More precisely, the CFSStandGrowth4R package makes it possible to 
- query the repository of meta-models 
- obtain predictions from a particular meta-model
