# CFSStandGrowth4R

An R client for the CFSStandGrowth Web API

## Introduction

The CFSStandGrowth4R package makes it possible to
- query the repository of meta-models through the CFSStandGrowth Web API
- obtain predictions of a particular meta-model

## License

The CFSStandGrowth4R package is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 3 (LGPL-3).

## Developers

- Jean-François Lavoie, Effixa inc.
- Mathieu Fortin, Canadian Wood Fibre Center

## Bug reporting

Please report any bug at https://github.com/CWFC-CCFB/CFSStandGrowth4R/issues.

## How to use it

The package can be installed using the remotes package:

~~~R
library(remotes)
install_github("CWFC-CCFB/CFSStandGrowth4R")
~~~

## Example of code

The code below provides the list of meta-models for the ecological type "MS22" (balsam fir-white birch on mesic sites) whose response variable is the all-species volume of living trees.

~~~R
library("CFSStandGrowth4R")

fields <- SGGetMetaModelQueryFields()
print(fields)

query <- SGQuery(SGContains("stratumGroup", "MS22"), SGAnd(), SGContains("outputType", "AllSpecies"))

listMetaModels <- SGFilterMetaModels(query)
print(listMetaModels$mmid)
~~~

Combinations of attributes can be extracted through the SGGetMetaModelFieldCombinations function:

~~~R
result <- SGGetMetaModelFieldCombinations(c("geoDomain", "growthModel"))
~~~

The result data.frame instance contains three columns, the first two containing the combinations of geoDomain and growthModel values. The last column provides the count of meta models for each combination. 
It is possible to include more fields in the vector argument of the function.

Each meta-model is attributed an id (mmid) which is a character string containing the following information:

- The province
- The area within the province
- The potential vegetation type
- The climate scenario
- The response variable
- The species

For instance, the following mmid "QC_4OUEST_MS22_NoChange_AliveVolume_AllSpecies" contains this information:
- The province of Quebec (QC)
- The area within the province is the bioclimatic subdomain 4OUEST
- The balsam fir-white birch potential ecological type (MS22)
- The climate scenario (NO_CHANGE)
- The response variable is the volume of living trees (AliveVolume)
- The meta-model was fitted on the all-species volume (AllSpecies)


The goodness of fit of a particular meta-model can be visualized using the SGGOFGraph 
function. The SGPredict function provides predictions from particular meta-models as in
the following example:

~~~R
SGGOFGraph("QC_4OUEST_MS22_NoChange_AliveVolume_AllSpecies")
predMS22 <- SGPredict("QC_4OUEST_MS22_NoChange_AliveVolume_AllSpecies", 1, 150)
~~~
